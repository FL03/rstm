***

_**The library is currently in the early stages of development and is still settling in on a feel for the api.**_

Welcome to `rstm`! This crate provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating and executing Turing machines. The crate is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to create and execute a wide range of Turing machines. Furthermore, the crate focuses on efficiency and leverages feature-gating to reduce overhead.

## Features

### Rules

```rust
    pub struct Rule<Q, S> {
        pub head: Head<Q, S>,
        pub tail: Tail<Q, S>,
    }
```

where `Head` and `Tail` are defined as follows:

```rust
    pub struct Head<Q, S> {
        pub state: Q,
        pub symbol: S,
    }

    pub struct Tail<Q, S> {
        pub direction: Direction,
        pub next_state: Q,
        pub write_symbol: S,
    }
```

#### Serialization

Enabling the `serde` feature will allow for serialization and deserialization of the `Rule` and other implementations within the crate. That being said, the serialization of the `Rule` macro is notable for the fact that it flattens both the `head` and `tail` fields, resulting in a more compact representation. Moreover, to facilitate interactions with javascript environments, the `[#serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` attribute is applied wherever applicable.

#### `rule!`, `rules!`, and other rule-based macros

Researchers have simplified the definition of a Turing machine, boiling it down into a dynamical system defined by a set of states, symbols, and rules. The rules define the behavior of the machine, dictating how it transitions from one state to another based on the current symbol being read. More specifically, the transition function $\delta$ where:

$$
\delta: Q\times{A}\rightarrow{Q}\times{A}\times{\lbrace\pm{1},0\rbrace}
$$

as defined within the paper [On the Topological Dynamics of Turing Machines](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(96)00025-4) by Petr KÅ¯rka. Therefore, we any rule-based procedural macros within the scope of `rstm` follow the following syntax:

```ignore
(state, symbol) -> Direction(next_state, next_symbol)
```

**Note:** the macros are hygenic, in the fact that they do not require the user to import any variants, traits, or other types into scope.

### Examples

For more examples visit the [examples](rstm/examples) directory.

#### **Example #1**: Using the `rule!` macro

The following example demonstrates the use of the `rule!` macro to define a single rule:

```rust
    // define the ruleset for the machine
    rstm::rule! {
        (0, 0) -> Right(1, 0);
    }
```

#### **Example #2**: Using the `rules!` macro

The following example demonstrates the use of the `rules!` macro to define a set of rules:

```rust
    rstm::rules! {
        (0, 0) -> Right(1, 0);
        (0, 1) -> Stay(-1, 1);
        (1, 0) -> Left(0, 1);
        (1, 1) -> Right(-1, 0);
        (-1, 0) -> Right(0, 0);
        (-1, 1) -> Right(1, 1);
    }
```

#### **Example #3**: Using the `program!` macro

The following example demonstrates the use of the `program!` macro to define a set of rules for a three-state, two-symbol Turing machine.

```rust
    // define the ruleset for the machine
    rstm::program! {
        #[default_state(0)]
        rules: {
            (0, 0) -> Right(1, 0);
            (0, 1) -> Stay(-1, 1);
            (1, 0) -> Left(0, 1);
            (1, 1) -> Right(-1, 0);
            (-1, 0) -> Right(0, 0);
            (-1, 1) -> Right(1, 1);
        };
    }
```

#### **Example #4**: Putting it all together with the `TMH` implementation

```rust
    extern crate rstm;

    use rstm::actors::TMH;
    use rstm::rules::Program;

    fn main() -> rstm::Result<()> {
        // initialize the logger
        tracing_subscriber::fmt()
            .with_max_level(tracing::Level::TRACE)
            .with_target(false)
            .with_timer(tracing_subscriber::fmt::time::uptime())
            .init();
        tracing::info!("Welcome to rstm!");
        // define some input for the machine
        let input = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0];
        // initialize the state of the machine
        let initial_state: isize = 0;
        // define the ruleset for the machine
        let program: Program<isize, usize> = rstm::program! {
            #[default_state(initial_state)]
            rules: {
                (0, 0) -> Right(1, 0);
                (0, 1) -> Left(-1, 1);
                (1, 0) -> Right(0, 1);
                (1, 1) -> Right(-1, 0);
                (-1, 0) -> Left(<isize>::MAX, 0);
                (-1, 1) -> Left(1, 1);
            };
        };
        // create a new instance of the machine
        let tm = TMH::new(initial_state, input.to_vec());
        // execute the program
        dbg!(tm).execute(program).run()?;
        Ok(())
    }
```
